> Undoing a Specific Commit (That Has Been Pushed)

I. Run git status and make sure you have a clean working tree.
II. run the command git log --oneline and copy the hash code of the commit you want to undo
III. Run git revert [hashcode] --no-edit.
IV. Lastly, run git push
V. NOTE: The --no-edit option prevents git from asking you to enter in a commit message. If you don't add that option, you'll end up in the VIM text editor. To exit VIM, press : to enter command mode, then q for quit, and finally hit Return (Mac) or Enter (Windows)


> Undoing a Specific Commit (Before being Pushed)

I. Run git reset --soft HEAD~
II. Add a number to the end to undo multiple commits. For example, to undo the last 2 commits (assuming both have not been pushed) run git reset --soft HEAD~2
